# webScrapers
This will be a repo for webscrapers and webcrawlers. THe titel says webscrapers because thats what they will be predominatly as Im just starting out at this point and they will be very basic.

Each .py file will have comments inside detailed what each section of code does. I suggest you use vscode with "better comments" extension enabled as I have made coloured comments for different purposes.
